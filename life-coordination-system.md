## Daily Usage (2-3 minutes total)

### Morning Routine (1 minute):
1. Open **Daily Coordination Hub**
2. Update today's date
3. Set energy level and peak focus time
4. Write your Big 3 tasks for school/work/personal

### Evening Routine (1 minute):
1. Check off completed tasks
2. Set tomorrow's focus areas
3. Add energy tracker entry if energy was notably high or low

### Weekly Review (5 minutes - Sunday):
1. Look at energy patterns from the week in Energy Tracker
2. Archive completed personal tasks
3. Plan next week's main priorities

## Why Energy Tracking Helps Prevent Burnout

### **Pattern Recognition**
After a week, you'll notice:
- "I'm always low energy after late work meetings"
- "My peak hours are 10am-12pm for difficult work"
- "I've been low energy 4 days this week - need rest"

### **Smart Scheduling**
Instead of forcing hard work when exhausted:
- **High Energy Day**: Schedule difficult coding + challenging study
- **Low Energy Day**: Do easier tasks + administrative work
- **Medium Energy**: Mix of moderate difficulty tasks

### **Early Warning System**
```
Week 1: Good, Medium, Good, Medium, Good = Sustainable
Week 2: Medium, Low, Low, Medium, Low = Warning - adjust schedule
Week 3: Low, Low, Medium, Low, Low = Burnout risk - need rest
```

## Advanced Features (Add Later If Needed)

### Notion Calendar Integration
1. Connect Personal Life Tasks to Notion Calendar
2. Set due dates to appear on calendar
3. Time-block personal tasks alongside work/school

### Context-Based Views
Create filtered views in Personal Tasks:
- "At Home" - Tasks you can do at home
- "Campus Tasks" - Things to do while at school  
- "Quick Wins" - 15-minute tasks for spare time
- "Errands" - Tasks for when you're out

### Weekly Planning Template
Add to Daily Coordination Hub:
```
## This Week's Focus
**School Priority**: [Main academic goal this week]
**Work Priority**: [Main work goal this week]
**Personal Priority**: [Main personal goal this week]

## Anti-Overwhelm Rules

1. **5-Minute Daily Limit** - Never spend more than 5 minutes on system maintenance
2. **Start Simple** - Use basic version first month, add features only if needed
3. **Skip Days Without Guilt** - System should help, not create pressure
4. **Weekly Health Check** - If system feels burdensome, remove features

This system fills your coordination gap without duplicating your existing school and work tools. Start with the basic setup and grow it only as needed.
