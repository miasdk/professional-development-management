# 🎯 Epic Management System - Hybrid Evolution

## Quick Start Epic Management

### 1. Initialize Project Epics
```bash
# Create epic issues for your project
./scripts/create-epics.sh [project-name] [sprint-count]

# Example: 4-sprint project
./scripts/create-epics.sh my-healthcare-app 4
```

### 2. Daily Progress Tracking
```bash
# Post daily progress to current epic
./scripts/daily-update.sh [epic-number] [time-spent] [completed-tasks]

# Example daily update
./scripts/daily-update.sh 1 "2.5h" "Completed Django models, set up database migrations, implemented user authentication"
```

### 3. Business Research Integration
```bash
# Generate market research templates
./scripts/research-kickstart.sh [project-name] [domain]

# Example: Healthcare project research
./scripts/research-kickstart.sh medical-referral-hub healthcare
```
