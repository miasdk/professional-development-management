   - Sunday: Set up project management (JIRA) and life coordination

2. **First Week Usage**:
   - Use daily coordination dashboard for work-school-life balance
   - Apply professional Git workflows to all projects
   - Practice communication templates in team interactions

3. **Ongoing Growth**:
   - Weekly reviews using established templates
   - Monthly system optimization based on usage patterns
   - Quarterly expansion into advanced features as needed

## Key Features

### **Industry-Standard Alignment**
- Follows GitHub Flow (not complex GitFlow)
- Implements Google's engineering practices for code review
- Uses Atlassian's proven project management patterns
- Integrates with modern development tools (GitHub Actions, Jira, Notion)

### **Educational AI Focus**
- Specific considerations for educational technology compliance (FERPA, COPPA)
- AI agent development workflows and RAG system patterns
- Startup-friendly processes that scale with growth
- Remote work optimization for distributed teams

### **Practical Implementation**
- Step-by-step setup guides with exact instructions
- Real-world templates and examples from industry practice
- Mobile-optimized workflows for on-the-go management
- Anti-overwhelm safeguards to prevent system abandonment
