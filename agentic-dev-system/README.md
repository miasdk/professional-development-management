## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### 1. Copy System to Your Project
```bash
# Copy the entire hybrid-evolution-system directory
cp -r hybrid-evolution-system/ /path/to/your/new-project/project-setup/

# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/new-project/project-setup/
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project
```bash
# Fill out SETUP.md with your project details (2 minutes)
# Then create GitHub epics
./scripts/create-epics.sh [your-project-name] [sprint-count]

# Example: 4-sprint healthcare project
./scripts/create-epics.sh medical-ai-assistant 4
```

### 3. Start Building
```bash
# Give SETUP.md to any AI agent and begin development!
# Use daily progress tracking
./scripts/daily-update.sh 1 "2h" "Completed initial setup and database models"
```
