## Sprint Planning Setup

### Sprint Configuration
- **Sprint Length**: 1 week (perfect for 20hrs/week schedule)
- **Sprint Capacity**: 8-12 story points max
- **Sprint Goal**: Focus on 3-5 small to medium tasks

### Weekly Sprint Routine

**Monday - Sprint Planning (30 mins)**:
- Review backlog
- Select 8-12 points of work
- Break down large tasks
- Set weekly goal

**Wednesday - Mid-Sprint Check (15 mins)**:
- Update task progress
- Flag any blockers
- Adjust scope if needed

**Friday - Sprint Review (15 mins)**:
- Move completed tasks to Done
- Note what went well/poorly
- Plan next sprint

## JIRA Best Practices for New Developers

### Task Management
1. **Only work on 1-2 tasks at a time**
2. **Update status daily** (even if no progress)
3. **Add comments** for significant updates or blockers
4. **Use time tracking** to understand your velocity
5. **Link related tasks** using JIRA relationships

### Communication in JIRA
- **@mention team members** for questions
- **Tag relevant people** on important updates  
- **Be specific** in comments and descriptions
- **Use labels** consistently for easy filtering

### Estimation Guidelines
- **1 point**: Simple config change, minor text update
- **2 points**: Small component update, simple bug fix
- **3 points**: New small component, medium complexity bug
- **5 points**: Feature component, complex integration
- **8 points**: Major feature, significant refactor

## Quick Setup Checklist
- [ ] Create Kanban project with 5 columns
- [ ] Save story templates
- [ ] Set up first sprint (current week)
- [ ] Create 2-3 practice tasks to test workflow
- [ ] Configure notifications (daily digest recommended)
- [ ] Set up filters for "My Issues" and "Recently Updated"

## Integration Tips
- **Link GitHub commits**: Include JIRA key (PWT-123) in commit messages
- **Connect with Notion**: Link JIRA tasks in daily dashboard
- **Slack notifications**: Set up for task assignments and mentions
